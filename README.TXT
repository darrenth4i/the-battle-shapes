It's not the battle cats I swear

Make sure to do work on **dev branch**

Make sure to update on group chat when pushing

If conflicting file: 
      DO USE modified file from origin/dev
        COPY PASTE YOUR CODE AND SAVE IT ELSEWHERE THEN ADD IT INTO NEW PULLED FILE (or else it will overwrite your own code) 

      DO NOT USE "MODIFIED FILE FROM DEV" (this overwrites the code from online)
